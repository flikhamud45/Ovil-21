class Protocol(ABC):
    """
    An abstract class for a custom protocol implementation.

    The `bytes_needed` is used to determine the minimum number of bytes needed to be
    read from the connection to identify all of the protocols. This is done by getting
    the `max()` of the `bytes_needed` of all the protocols, and reading that many
    bytes from the connection.

    Args:
        bytes_needed: The minimum number of bytes needed to identify the protocol.
