class Host:
    """
    Dataclass representing an `mitm` host.

    A host is a pair of `asyncio.StreamReader` and `asyncio.StreamWriter` objects
    that are used to communicate with the remote host. There are two types of hosts: a
    client, and a server. A client host is one that is connected to the `mitm`, and a
    server host is one that the `mitm` connected to on behalf of the client.

    The `mitm_managed` attribute is used to determine whether the `mitm` should
    manage the host. If `mitm_managed` is `True`, the `mitm` will close the host
    when it is done with it. If `mitm_managed` is `False`, the `mitm` will not
    close the host.

    Note:
        See more on `dataclasses <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.

    Args:
        reader: The reader of the host.
        writer: The writer of the host.
        mitm_managed: Whether or not the host is managed by the `mitm`.

    Properties:
        reader: The reader of the host.
        writer: The writer of the host.
        mitm_managed: Whether or not the host is managed by the `mitm`.
        ip: The IP address of the host.
        port: The port of the host.
